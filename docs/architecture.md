# Architecture

How the car's software is put together: every node, every topic, and how they connect. Everything communicates over ROS2 Jazzy topics — there is no shared memory or direct function calls between packages, so this topic map *is* the system.

## The node graph

This is what `ros2 launch f1tenth_stack bringup_launch.py` actually starts, plus the optional layers you add on top of it (mapping, localization, autonomy).

Everything below `/scan` and `/odom` is optional and layered on top depending on what you're doing:

```

        │
        ├──► slam_toolbox (mapping mode) ──► /map, saved to a .yaml+.pgm file

        └──► particle_filter (localization,  ──► /pf/viz/inferred_pose, /pf/pose/odom
              needs a saved map + /odom)          (your planner would consume these)
```

Race day layers one more node on top of `particle_filter`'s output — see [racing-autonomy.md](racing-autonomy.md) for the full pipeline (map once, localize, record a lap, pace it into a racing line, then race it):

```
/pf/viz/inferred_pose ──┬──► pure_pursuit_node ──► /drive   (needs a saved map, a working
/scan ───────────────────┘    localization launch, and a recorded + paced racing line .csv —
                               see docs/racing-autonomy.md)
```

`web_dashboard` is passive and layers on top of whatever's already running — it never publishes, so it isn't part of the driving path at all, just a viewer for it (see [web-dashboard.md](web-dashboard.md)):

```

/pf/viz/inferred_pose ───┘    (read-only; no /drive, no /joy, exempt from the deadman policy below)
```

| `f1tenth_stack` (in `f1tenth_system`) | git submodule, `humble-devel` | Owns the launch files and all the YAML configs (`vesc.yaml`, `sensors.yaml`, `mux.yaml`, `joy_teleop.yaml`) that wire everything below together |
| `vesc_driver`, `vesc_ackermann`, `vesc_msgs` (in `vesc`) | git submodule (nested inside `f1tenth_system`), `humble` | Talks to the VESC over serial; converts between Ackermann drive commands and raw VESC motor/servo commands |
| `serial_driver`, `io_context` (in `transport_drivers`) | git submodule, `humble` | Low-level serial port library the VESC driver is built on |
| `urg_node` | apt (`ros-jazzy-urg-node`) | Hokuyo LiDAR driver |
| `joy`, `joy_teleop`, `teleop_tools` | apt / submodule | Gamepad input and teleop mapping |
| `ackermann_mux` (in `f1tenth_system`) | git submodule, `humble-devel` | Arbitrates between teleop and autonomy commands — see safety model below |
| `particle_filter`, `range_libc` | git submodules, `humble-devel` | Monte Carlo localization against a saved map |
| `slam_toolbox` | apt (`ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox`) | Builds a map by driving the car around manually |
| `gap_follow` | local, `src/gap_follow` | Baseline reactive autonomy (follow-the-gap) — see [writing-your-own-node.md](writing-your-own-node.md), this package *is* the worked example |
| `pure_pursuit` | local, `src/pure_pursuit` | Map-based race controller (pure pursuit over a curvature-paced recorded racing line) plus the tools to record and pace one — see [racing-autonomy.md](racing-autonomy.md) |
| `web_dashboard` | local, `src/web_dashboard` | Read-only live browser dashboard of the map/scan/pose over a WebSocket — never publishes anything, not subject to the deadman policy below — see [web-dashboard.md](web-dashboard.md) |
| `racerbot_launch` | local, `src/racerbot_launch` | Launch files that don't belong to any single driver package (currently: SLAM, and race-day localization+pure_pursuit) |

## The safety model (read this before writing autonomy code)

`ackermann_mux` picks between two input channels and publishes the winner to `/ackermann_cmd`:

```yaml
joystick:   topic: teleop, priority: 100, timeout: 0.2s
navigation: topic: drive,  priority: 10,  timeout: 0.2s
```

Higher priority wins, *as long as that channel hasn't gone silent for more than its timeout*. The intent is straightforward: a human on the joystick should always be able to override autonomy.

**Important, verified behavior:** `joy_teleop`'s `default` profile (in `joy_teleop.yaml`) has no deadman-button restriction — it runs unconditionally and continuously publishes a neutral `(steering=0, speed=0)` command to `/teleop` at all times, whether or not LB is held. This means `/teleop` **never times out** as long as `joy_node` + `joy_teleop` are running, so it **always** wins arbitration over `/drive` — even when nobody is touching the controller.

This was directly confirmed by test: with the full bringup running and LB *not* held, publishing a distinct, continuous command to `/drive` had zero effect on `/ackermann_cmd`, which stayed locked at `0.0 / 0.0` the whole time.

**Practical consequence: your autonomy node's `/drive` commands will never reach the VESC while `joy_node` and `joy_teleop` are both running.** See [operations.md](operations.md#running-autonomy-gap_follow-pure_pursuit-or-your-own-node) for the correct procedure. There's an unused hook for this in `joy_teleop.yaml` — an `autonomous_control` profile bound to the RB button — but it currently just publishes an `Int8` to `/dev/null` (a no-op placeholder), it isn't wired to anything that would let `joy_teleop` stop overriding `/drive`. If your team wants a clean "flip RB to hand off to autonomy" workflow, that's the place to build it — it doesn't exist yet.

### Workspace policy: the LB deadman button is mandatory for every node that can move the car

**Current, standing policy — read this before running or writing any driving code.** Regardless of the `ackermann_mux` arbitration above, no code in this workspace — autonomous or not — is allowed to move the car unless the driver is actively holding **LB** on the physical controller. Manual teleop already works this way (`joy_teleop`'s `human_control` profile is deadman-gated). **This policy stays in force, unrelaxed, until the team has explicitly confirmed the car's behavior is trustworthy enough to change it.**

Both autonomy nodes currently in this workspace enforce this in code, not just by convention: `gap_follow_node` and `pure_pursuit_node` each subscribe to `/joy` directly and refuse to publish a non-zero drive command unless button index `deadman_button` (default `4`, i.e. LB) is currently held on a live `/joy` stream (`joy_timeout_sec`, default `0.5s`) — checked *first*, ahead of every other watchdog either node has. This is a **second, independent safety layer on top of** the mux arbitration above: even once `/teleop` has been silenced (see [operations.md](operations.md#running-autonomy-gap_follow-pure_pursuit-or-your-own-node)), the autonomy node itself still won't drive without LB held. Concretely, this means **`joy_node` must be left running** — with LB held — while any autonomy node drives; only `joy_teleop` should be stopped.

Each node exposes this as an `enable_deadman` parameter (default `true` in both `gap_follow.yaml` and `pure_pursuit.yaml`). **Do not set it to `false` on either node** — that would be a unilateral decision to bypass the current policy, not just a tuning change. **Any new autonomy node added to this workspace must implement the same check before it's allowed to drive the car** — see [writing-your-own-node.md](writing-your-own-node.md#the-interface-contract) for the required pattern.

## Frame conventions

- `base_link`: origin of the car, at the rear axle (matches `wheelbase: 0.25m` in `vesc.yaml`, used by `vesc_to_odom_node` for odometry)
- `laser`: the Hokuyo's frame, offset `+0.27m` forward / `+0.11m` up from `base_link` (fixed, via `static_transform_publisher`)
- `odom`: continuous but drifting frame, published by `vesc_to_odom_node` from wheel-speed + servo-angle integration (no encoders/IMU fusion — this is dead-reckoning only)
- `map`: only exists once `slam_toolbox` or `particle_filter`'s `map_server` is running

Note `slam_toolbox`'s configured `base_frame` is `laser`, not `base_link` (see `f1tenth_stack/config/f1tenth_online_async.yaml`) — a deliberate upstream choice, not a typo, but worth knowing if you're debugging a `tf` tree.
